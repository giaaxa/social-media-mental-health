# EDA Summary Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-23 18:09
**Dataset:** smmh_clean.csv (n=478 social media users)

## Key Findings

1. **Social comparison is strongly associated with low mood.** Respondents who frequently compare themselves to successful people on social media report higher low mood frequency (rho=0.40, p<0.001).

2. **Purposeless scrolling correlates with low mood.** Those who use social media without specific purpose more often report higher low mood frequency (rho=0.29, p<0.001).

3. **Validation-seeking behaviour shows a moderate association with low mood.** Respondents who more frequently seek validation through social media features also report higher low mood (rho=0.26, p<0.001).

## Hypothesis Test Results

| Hypothesis | Association | Effect Size | Significant? |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| H1: daily_time_band -> low_mood_freq | H=53.70 | moderate | Yes |
| H2: purposeless_use -> low_mood_freq | rho=0.29 | small | Yes |
| H3: compare_to_successful -> low_mood_freq | rho=0.40 | moderate | Yes |
| H4: seek_validation -> low_mood_freq | rho=0.26 | small | Yes |
| H5: restless_without_sm -> sleep_issues | rho=0.16 | small | Yes |

## Limitations

1. **Cross-sectional data:** Cannot determine causality.
2. **Self-reported measures:** Subject to recall bias.
3. **Sample composition:** Dominated by university students aged 18-24.
